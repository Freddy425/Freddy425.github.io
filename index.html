            <p style= "color: white">Hello, my name is Frederick Hrehirchuk, with my education in the computer systems technology course makes me the ideal candidate for the Computer Support Technician position that you have posted on your website. Some of the skills I have acquired are verbal and written communication, Data and Document Management, Building Computers from parts, Data Communications and Networking and Operating Systems Fundamentals.
                What I have learned in the program, has made me accomplish skills like, better writing and verbal communication. Verbal skills let me get along well with clients or staff. Since I have taken data and document management, I am well organized with computers. In hardware class we learned the different components of the computer, which will allow me to take computers apart and put them back together with ease. I know my way around an operating system, and I know the tests involved in figuring out networking problems. I know of the commands in PowerShell or Command Prompt to diagnose networking problems. I also do well at installing applications because of what I learned in Operating Systems Fundamentals. For my home project, I installed Linux on a laptop and then updated the applications on it.
                Some more information about me; since my volunteer work at a veterinary clinic, I’ve become a great leader, I work well with others, I’m reliable, and I am also a problem solver.
            </p>

                I have always wanted to know how computers worked. I took the Computer Systems Technology program, first as a hobby. Then I realized I really
                enjoyed programming and working with computers. I really like GNU's free software idea. Linux is my favourite operating system.
                In my free time I like playing around with blender and to make models in it. I will 3D print them when models start to look good.
